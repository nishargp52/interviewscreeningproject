Question 1
I spend about 2 hours on the solution that i have uploaded. 
If I had more time I would have made it more scalable and cleaner. For e.g for the pageobject file i would have create a variable section and assigned variable to each locator hence making the pageobjects bit cleaner.
Also if i had more time i would have also tried impleting data Driven framework where i would pass all the data in form of excel/XMl. This depends on scope of the project.

Question 2
I think as automation is becoming more popular form of testing the real purpose of automation in the QA testing world is being misunderstood. I think automation is ideal for regression testing scripts or for features that have been verified manually to have no defects adn hence can be automated for regression purpose for future releases. But it has turned into main form of testing which is very inefficient and waste of automation
Also automation is being use not only for QA testing but for API testing, preformance testing and also testing analytics tags for release regressions.

Question 3
For legacy application i would look at the current regression testing package being used to test to manual test those applciation. From the list of testcases I would determine priority of testcases adn automated the testcases that hasve Severity 1 or Severity 2 category. To make sure most important fucntionality are tested with least minimal effort for legacy applciations as well.
This is the approach we have taken at my current workplace. Where i am part of team responsible to turning all the leagacy manual testcases to automated testcases from the regression package.

Question 4

I dotn really have opinion on improvements for JUST EAT. Based on what i saw while working in the website for this project. I am satisfied i did not see any eye-popping issues that would stop me from using the webpage or placing my order.
